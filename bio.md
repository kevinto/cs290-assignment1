Name: Kevin To

Programming Background:
- I currently work as a software engineer with predominently backend software. The languages I typically code in is Microsoft FoxPro and C#. I occasionally get to use javascipt.
- My Favorite project in CS162/CS161 was the project involving the implementation of Conway's game of life.

Hobbies:
  I enjoy reading books, mostly fiction, but I also enjoy the occasional non-fictional book. I also enjoy hiking and watching movies. I recently got into shooting, so I have been going to gun ranges more often.
